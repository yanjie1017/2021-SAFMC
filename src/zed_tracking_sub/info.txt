The odometry pose is calculated with a pure “visual odometry” algorithm as the sum of the movement from one step to the next. It is therefore affected by drift.

The camera pose is instead continuously fixed using the Stereolabs tracking algorithm that combines visual information, space memory information and, if using a “ZED-M,” inertial information.


The ZED wrapper publishes two kinds of positions:

odometry: The position calculated as the sum of the movements relative to the previous position. Only the pure visual odometry is used

pose: The position calculated relative to the world map. Historical information about the environment is used and Inertial data (if using a ZED-M) are fused to get a better 6 DoF pose

odom: Odometry pose referred to odometry frame (only visual odometry is applied for ZED, visual-inertial for ZED-M)
pose: Camera pose referred to Map frame (complete data fusion algorithm is applied)
pose_with_covariance: Camera pose referred to Map frame with covariance
path_odom: The sequence of camera odometry poses in Map frame
path_map: The sequence of camera poses in Map frame
